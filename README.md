üõ°Ô∏è Password Breach Checker
This is a secure, client-side tool built to help you check if your password has been compromised in a known data breach. It uses the "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP) Pwned Passwords API and a k-Anonymity model to ensure your password's privacy is maintained throughout the process.

‚ú® Key Features
Secure & Private: Your password is never sent to any server. It's hashed in your browser, and only the first 5 characters of the hash are used to query the API.

Instant Feedback: Quickly see if your password has been found in a data breach and how many times it has appeared.

K-Anonymity Model: Leverages the HIBP API's privacy model to protect your data during the check.

Educational: Aims to educate users on the importance of strong, unique passwords and good security hygiene.

Modern UI: Clean, simple, and responsive interface built with modern web technologies.
